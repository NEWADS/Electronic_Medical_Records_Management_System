# Electronic_Medical_Records_Management_System
This is a website for EMR system using php, running on WAMP server, and this is my software engineering course design work.   

## How to run this website?
I used MySQL for the database, so you need to import the .sql file before start.
There are many ways to import .sql files to your SQL databases, if you are using WAMP server, just open phpmyadmin on browser, then create a new database using UTF-8_general_ci.
(Unfinished.)
